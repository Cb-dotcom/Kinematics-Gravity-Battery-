## Introduction

In light of the growing environmental concerns associated with conventional energy storage systems such as lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries, this project proposes a novel solution: the gravity battery. Traditional batteries face several challenges, including adverse environmental impacts, disposal issues, efficiency limitations, and lengthy charging times. While renewable energy sources like solar and wind can mitigate some environmental issues, they are plagued by intermittency, and options like hydro energy come with substantial spatial requirements. 

This project introduces a gravity battery that stores electrical energy in the form of potential energy. When needed, this potential energy can be converted back into kinetic energy, driving a generator to produce electricity. A physical prototype of this gravity battery has been designed, developed, and demonstrated as part of this project.

## Architecture

The project comprises the following components:

- **Matlab Code**: This includes an animation of the Crank-Rocker gravity battery and tests for the Grashof condition.
  
- **SolidWorks Design**: Detailed designs of the gearbox and gravity battery are created in SolidWorks, providing a visual representation of the system.

- **Reference Article**: A comprehensive article that elaborates on the concepts and background research supporting this project.

- **PowerPoint Presentation**: A presentation showcasing all outputs, graphs, and animations generated throughout the project.

- **Project Report**: A detailed report discussing all the underlying concepts and methodologies involved in the development of the gravity battery.

## Conclusion

The Kinematics Gravity Battery project aims to address the limitations of conventional energy storage systems by proposing a sustainable alternative that utilizes gravitational potential energy. Through the development of a physical prototype and comprehensive analysis, this project contributes to the ongoing exploration of innovative energy storage solutions.
